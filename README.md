# lll-creation-patterns

Various ways to implement Ethereum contract copying, at different degrees
of homogeneity, using LLL.

See [`lll-contracts`](https://gitlab.com/veox/lll-contracts), where the
programs here originated from, for some simpler examples.

[Populus](https://github.com/ethereum/populus/) is used for development.
Although `requirements.txt` specifies `populus==2.1.0`, the actual version
required is the one in [my `populus/lll-to-merge`
branch](https://github.com/veox/populus/tree/lll-to-merge), at least until
[`ethereum/populus` PR 408](https://github.com/ethereum/populus/pull/408)
is merged.
